# Week 1 Assignment – HTML5 Semantic Page

## ✨ Description
This is my Week 1 assignment for the Web Development module. The task was to create a simple, accessible, and SEO-friendly web page using **only HTML5 semantic tags**.

## 🧱 What I Built
- A fully semantic HTML5 web page
- Structured using: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Includes a logical heading hierarchy for SEO
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and alt text (if needed)

## ♿ Accessibility Features
- Used proper landmarks like `<nav>` and `<main>`
- Added `aria-label` for screen reader navigation
- Page structure is clean and keyboard-friendly

## 🔍 SEO Considerations
- Used heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h2>`) in logical order
- Included a `<meta name="description">` tag
- Content is clear, descriptive, and human-readable

## 📁 Files Included
- `index.html`: The main web page
- `README.md`: This file

## ✅ How to View
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any browser.
3. Or use Live Server in VS Code for real-time viewing.
